					<p class="match-day__content__p observe-element">Ehson Jafree sat patiently in his car, waiting his turn to pull through the driveway, receive his envelope and learn what his future holds. </p>
					<p class="match-day__content__p observe-element">One of the 146 EVMS fourth-year medical students who participated in this year’s match, Mr. Jafree understood that this was a Match Day unlike any other.</p>
					<p class="match-day__content__p observe-element">
						Due to requirements of social distancing in light of COVID-19, a traditional ceremony wasn’t held, but EVMS students were able to pick up their Match Day envelopes at a drive-through at Smith-Rogers Hall.</p>
		
					<p class="match-day__content__p observe-element">“A lot of programs aren’t doing anything,” Mr. Jafree says, “so we appreciate that they put a lot of effort into doing something for us. This is great.”</p>
					<p class="match-day__content__p observe-element">According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, nearly 35,000 U.S. and international applicants matched to residency training positions at the nation's teaching hospitals this year. EVMS students matched into several highly competitive programs, including the Mayo Clinic.</p>
					<p class="match-day__content__p observe-element"> “These talented and community-minded students are entering the world of medicine at a time when the world needs health professionals the most,” says Ronald Flenner, MD (MD ’89), Vice Dean of Academic Affairs. “I know this isn’t the Match Day our students had envisioned for themselves, but we wanted to do everything we could to celebrate their successes.”</p>

							<li class="match-day__stats__list__list-item observe-element">41% of the class is pursuing primary care</li>
							<li class="match-day__stats__list__list-item observe-element">30% of the class will stay in Virginia for at least their first year of residency</li>
							<li class="match-day__stats__list__list-item observe-element">The top represented specialties were internal medicine at 18%, surgery at 13%, emergency medicine at 13%, pediatrics at 11% and family medicine at 7%</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p class="match-day__content__p observe-element">The matching process is organized by the National Resident Matching Program, which uses an algorithm to pair medical students and residency programs. Fourth-year medical students across the nation apply to residency positions in their chosen specialty — such as pediatrics or surgery. After hitting the interview trail, the students rank the programs according to those they would prefer to join. The programs, in turn, rank the students they feel will make the best fit. Nearly all applicants learned the results of that ranking process at the same time.</p>
